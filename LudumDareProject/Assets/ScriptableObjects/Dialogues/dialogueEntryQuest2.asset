    You see, here
    lies Edward.

    We were ambushed by a group of goblins.

    it was all so
    fast.

    I couln''t even say goodbye to him.

    I wish there was a way I
    could talk to him.

    At least one last time.'
  questInProgress_: 'Oh, [name]. I miss you so much.

    If only I could see your
    face.

    And talk to you.

    One last time.'
  questAfterSuccess_: 'Oh, Edward. It is you!

    I''ve missed you so much.

    I

    I LOVE YOU EDWARD

    FROM THE DEEPEST OF MY
    HEART.

    And I will always carry you with me

    In my memories

    Until
    we are united again in death.'

  questFinished_: 'Thank you for helping me.

    At least I had a chance to express
    to him

    how much he meant to me.'
