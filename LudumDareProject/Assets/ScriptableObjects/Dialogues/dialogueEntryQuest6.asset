  questNotInitialized_: 'Hey you!

    Yes you!

    You are the new summoner right?

    Oh
    please help me. I beg you.

    A curse has fell on me.

    I might not look
    like it, but I am 26.

    This bloody curse has aged me like milk.

    Do you
    think you can invoke something to remove the curse?'
  questInProgress_: 'Summoner please. I beg you.

    Give me something to reverse
    the curse.

    I don''t want to die so young.'
  questAfterSuccess_: 'This! This will do it.

    Oh thank you summoner.

    I
    will drink it as soon as I get home.

    I can''t wait to be young and beautiful
    again.'
  questAfterFail_: 'IS THIS A JOKE TO YOU?

    Sorry.

    That was inappropiate.

    I
    am just... so tired of being old.'
  questFinished_: 'I''ll drink the potion when I get home.

    I can''t wait to
    be young and beautiful again.

    Hey that''s kind of poetic.

    Maybe someone
    should write a song like that.'
