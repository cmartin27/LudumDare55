  questNotInitialized_: 'Hello stranger.

    Oh you are the new summoner?

    Nice
    to meet you I am Anna.

    Maybe you can help me.

    My sister left me to
    go live in the mountains.

    She made a giant ice castle (don''t tell me how)

    Ever
    since she left, I''ve felt so lonely.

    Could you make me something that reminded
    me of her?'
  questInProgress_: 'I miss my sister so much.

    If only I could have something
    that reminded me of her.'
  questAfterSuccess_: 'What... what is this?

    A snowman?

    Oh it''s perfect
    dear summoner!

    But a snowman needs a name.

    You know what? I''m going
    to call you Olaf.

    Olaf the snowman.'
  questAfterFail_: "Thank you for your effort dear summoner.\_\nHowever that does
    not have anything to do with my sister.\nI wish you could invoke something cold."
  questFinished_: "Elsa I still miss you.\_\nBut at least with Olaf\nI can wait for
    your return accompanied."
