  questNotInitialized_: 'Hello fellow soldier.

    Sorry if I am not very talkative.

    I
    hit my head really bad.

    I need to find something to reduce the inflammation
    quickly.'
  questInProgress_: "Soldier. You are back.\nDo you know where I could find \nsomething
    to reduce my head inflammation?"
  questAfterSuccess_: 'Oh...

    A snowman...

    I guess it could technically
    work?

    I would have prefered some ice though.'
  questAfterFail_: Do you really think that could help me ease the pain?
  questFinished_: 'Hello soldier.

    Thank you for your help before.

    Even
    if it was a little bit unorthodox

    that snow really helped to reduce the
    inflammation.'
