  questNotInitialized_: "Help! Help!\nOh my bees, my poor bees.\nThey don't want
    to get out of the hive.\_\nI don't know why!\nMaybe they are depressed bees?\nDo
    you think that you could invoke something\nto make my bees happier?"
  questInProgress_: 'Have you come up with something to help my bees?

    They are
    very sad,

    if only I had something to cherish them.'
  questAfterSuccess_: 'A flower obviously!

    What else would a bee want?

    They
    look so happy now!

    Thank you sir, from the bottom of my heart.'
  questAfterFail_: 'Oh, I don''t think that is working.

    The bees are not much
    more animated.'
  questFinished_: 'The bees are so happy now.

    I''m sure this year they will
    produce the best honey yet.'
